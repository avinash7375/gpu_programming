Creating a GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) from scratch involves understanding both hardware design (architecture, circuits) and software (compilers, drivers, parallel programming models). Here's a comprehensive guide covering the entire process, starting from the basics of hardware architecture to advanced software concepts like parallel processing and optimization.

1. Core Concepts of GPU Design

A GPU is a highly parallel processor designed to handle multiple operations simultaneously. It excels at tasks where the same operation needs to be applied to large sets of data (e.g., rendering images, scientific simulations). Let's break down the core components:

1.1. Parallelism

SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data): GPUs are designed for data-level parallelism, meaning they perform the same operation on multiple data points simultaneously.

Thread-Level Parallelism: GPUs handle thousands of lightweight threads concurrently. Each thread runs the same kernel function on different data.

Vector Processing: Most GPU operations are vector-based, which allows for processing large datasets with a single instruction.


1.2. GPU Hardware Architecture

At the hardware level, a GPU is composed of several components:

ALUs (Arithmetic Logic Units): Responsible for performing arithmetic and logical operations. A GPU contains many ALUs to perform parallel computations.

Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs): The GPU is divided into several SMs. Each SM contains several cores that handle thread execution in parallel.

Memory Hierarchy:

Registers: Fast memory specific to each thread.

Shared Memory: Shared between threads within a block and very fast.

Global Memory: Accessible by all threads but slower.

Constant and Texture Memory: Used for read-only data, optimized for specific tasks.


Instruction Scheduling: A scheduler within each SM assigns work to threads, distributing them evenly across the available cores.


2. Building a GPU Hardware from Scratch

Creating a GPU requires knowledge of digital logic, computer architecture, and hardware description languages (HDLs) like Verilog or VHDL. Here's an outline of the steps involved:

2.1. Processor Design:

ALU Design: Design the Arithmetic Logic Unit using logic gates to perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, multiplication, etc.

Control Unit: Design a control unit to coordinate instruction execution by fetching instructions and managing memory accesses.

Registers: Create a set of registers to hold intermediate values during computation.


2.2. Design of SIMD/Vector Units

Vector Processing Units: Extend ALU design to handle vector operations (i.e., operations on arrays of data).

Instruction Set Architecture (ISA): Define the set of instructions the GPU will understand, focusing on parallel execution of vector operations.


2.3. Memory System

Global Memory: Design the interface for accessing large memory blocks that all threads can share.

Cache and Local Memory: Implement caching mechanisms for speeding up frequent data access.

Memory Controller: Handle data transfers between CPU, global memory, and the GPU itself.


2.4. Thread Scheduling Logic

Warp Scheduling: Implement a system for scheduling groups of threads (warps) to execute on available cores.

SIMD Execution: Ensure that the same instruction can be applied across multiple data points in parallel.


2.5. Bus Interface

PCIe Bus: For modern GPUs, implement a PCIe interface to connect the GPU to the CPU for data transfers.

3. Developing a Software Stack for the GPU

Once the hardware is built, you'll need a software stack that allows applications to communicate with the GPU. This involves writing drivers, a compiler, and a parallel programming model.

3.1. Device Drivers

The device driver is the low-level software that allows the operating system to communicate with the GPU.

Memory Management: The driver manages the memory space between the CPU and GPU, handling data transfers via DMA (Direct Memory Access).

Kernel Launching: It provides APIs for the CPU to schedule kernel execution on the GPU.

Thread Management: The driver manages thread creation, synchronization, and destruction.

Interrupt Handling: Handles interrupts raised by the GPU, such as when computation is finished or errors occur.


3.2. Compiler for the GPU ISA

The compiler takes high-level code written in a language like C or CUDA, compiles it down to the Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) of the GPU, and optimizes it for the hardware.

Frontend Compiler: Parses high-level programming languages like CUDA or OpenCL and converts them to an intermediate representation.

Optimization Passes: Includes optimizations for loop unrolling, instruction pipelining, and register allocation.

Backend Compiler: Translates the intermediate representation into the binary format that the GPU hardware can execute.


For example, NVIDIA's PTX (Parallel Thread Execution) is an intermediate language used for CUDA programs, which gets compiled down to the hardware-level ISA.

3.3. Parallel Programming Model

There are several programming models for writing GPU programs. Here’s how to build one similar to CUDA or OpenCL:

Kernel: Define functions (kernels) that run on the GPU. These kernels are launched by the CPU.

Thread Hierarchy: Organize computation into grids of thread blocks. Each block contains multiple threads, and all threads execute the same code.

Memory Access: Provide APIs for allocating memory on the GPU (device memory) and copying data between the CPU and GPU.

Synchronization Primitives: Implement synchronization mechanisms like barriers and atomic operations to ensure correct execution in parallel contexts.


The runtime needs to manage grid and block launches and schedule threads efficiently on the hardware.

4. Advanced GPU Design Topics

After the base GPU is built, advanced features can be added to improve performance and efficiency.

4.1. Unified Memory Architecture

Modern GPUs allow for unified memory where the CPU and GPU share the same memory space. This reduces the need for explicit data copying between the CPU and GPU.

Memory Coherency: Implement mechanisms to ensure memory consistency between CPU and GPU when both are reading/writing to the same memory.


4.2. Stream Processors and Asynchronous Execution

GPUs can support multiple independent operations simultaneously through streams:

Async Operations: Implement streams that allow overlapping computation with memory transfers, improving the throughput.

Stream Scheduling: The hardware should support multiple execution contexts, scheduling streams without blocking others.


4.3. Ray Tracing and Specialized Cores

Modern GPUs incorporate specialized hardware for specific tasks like ray tracing (used in realistic rendering).

RT Cores: These are hardware-accelerated cores for ray tracing. Building such cores involves designing circuitry optimized for bounding volume hierarchies (BVH) traversal and ray-box intersections.


4.4. Tensor Cores and AI Acceleration

GPUs designed for AI (like NVIDIA's Tensor Cores) include matrix-multiplication hardware optimized for deep learning operations.

Matrix Multiplication Units: Design specialized hardware that performs high-throughput matrix operations, which are common in machine learning workloads.


4.5. Power Efficiency and Thermal Design

GPUs consume a significant amount of power, and ensuring efficiency is crucial.

Power Management: Implement dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) to adjust the GPU’s power consumption based on workload.

Thermal Design: Ensure the chip can handle high-performance workloads without overheating. This includes designing cooling systems and managing heat dissipation.


4.6. Multi-GPU and SLI Support

For high-end applications (e.g., gaming, scientific computing), multiple GPUs can work together using technologies like NVIDIA's SLI or AMD’s CrossFire.

Inter-GPU Communication: Implement high-speed communication protocols (e.g., NVLink) between GPUs to allow sharing of data and load balancing.
