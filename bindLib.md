Creating an infrastructure like **CMake** for project binding involves designing a system that manages the build process of software, detecting and configuring the environment, setting up dependencies, and generating build files for different platforms and compilers. This type of tool is essential for large software projects to maintain portability, efficiency, and automation in the compilation process.

Here’s a basic guide to help you develop such a system:

### Key Components to Consider

1. **Configuration Files (Like CMakeLists.txt)**:
   - You need a way for developers to define how their project should be built (e.g., source files, target executables/libraries, dependencies, etc.).
   - This could be done via configuration files similar to `CMakeLists.txt`. You could create your own format or even use existing formats like JSON, YAML, or a custom domain-specific language (DSL).

2. **Toolchain/Compiler Abstraction**:
   - Your infrastructure should support different compilers (GCC, Clang, MSVC, etc.). You need to abstract the differences between these compilers to allow the build system to generate the appropriate commands.
   - CMake does this through toolchain files and specific configurations for each platform.

3. **Dependency Management**:
   - Integrate a system for finding external dependencies (libraries, packages, etc.). You can either support existing package managers like `pkg-config` or provide a built-in mechanism to handle dependencies.
   - CMake has `find_package` and `ExternalProject` modules for handling these tasks.

4. **Build Targets**:
   - A build system needs to differentiate between various types of targets such as executables, shared/static libraries, and test binaries.
   - These targets should have different build rules and link configurations.

5. **Platform and Architecture Independence**:
   - Your system should support multiple platforms (Linux, Windows, macOS) and architectures (x86, ARM, etc.). This requires handling platform-specific configurations (e.g., flags, file paths).
   - This can be done through platform detection logic, similar to how CMake uses `CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME`.

6. **Build Stages**:
   - Like CMake, your system should handle different build stages: **configure**, **build**, and **install**.
   - The **configure** stage detects the environment and sets up build options.
   - The **build** stage compiles and links the code.
   - The **install** stage places the output binaries and libraries in a specified location.

7. **Integration with IDEs**:
   - One of CMake’s strengths is its ability to generate project files for IDEs (e.g., Visual Studio, Xcode). You should consider a similar feature if you want widespread adoption.
   - This can be achieved by generating IDE-specific project files (e.g., `.sln` for Visual Studio or `.xcodeproj` for Xcode).

8. **Modular and Extensible**:
   - A modern build system should allow developers to extend its functionality. This can be done by providing plugin mechanisms or allowing custom scripts to be executed during the build process.

9. **Parallel Builds and Build Optimization**:
   - To speed up compilation, support for parallel builds (like `make -j`) and incremental builds is important. CMake does this by generating build systems compatible with tools like `ninja` and `make`.

### Steps to Develop Your Own Build System

1. **Define the Syntax for the Configuration File**:
   - Start by defining a syntax to describe the project structure. For example, a simple configuration file might look like:
     ```yaml
     project: MyApp
     type: executable
     sources:
       - main.cpp
       - utils.cpp
     dependencies:
       - mylibrary
     ```
   - This file format could be JSON, YAML, or even a custom DSL.

2. **Parser for the Configuration File**:
   - Write a parser that reads the configuration file and stores the information in memory.
   - Based on this information, you will later generate the appropriate build files.

3. **Platform and Compiler Detection**:
   - Implement functions that detect the host operating system and the available compilers. You can use the output from commands like `uname`, `which gcc`, `which clang`, etc.
   - Store platform-specific flags, directories, and configurations that will later be used for generating the appropriate build commands.

4. **Generating Build Files**:
   - Once you’ve parsed the configuration and detected the environment, write logic to generate build files. These could be `Makefiles`, `Ninja` build scripts, or even Visual Studio solution files.
   - Example of a simple `Makefile` generated by your system:
     ```Makefile
     CC = gcc
     CFLAGS = -Wall -g
     SOURCES = main.cpp utils.cpp
     TARGET = MyApp

     $(TARGET): $(SOURCES)
         $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o $(TARGET) $(SOURCES)
     ```

5. **Build Execution**:
   - Add a command to actually trigger the build (invoking `make`, `ninja`, or other tools). This command should run the generated build files.
   - Example:
     ```sh
     ./my_build_system configure
     ./my_build_system build
     ./my_build_system install
     ```

6. **Extending for Dependency Management**:
   - Implement functionality to find external libraries using `pkg-config`, or provide a mechanism where users can manually specify library paths.

7. **Testing and Continuous Integration**:
   - Include testing capabilities by providing built-in commands to run unit tests after the build process.
   - Example:
     ```yaml
     test:
       - tests/test_main.cpp
     ```

### Tools and Libraries to Leverage

- **File Parsing**: Use libraries for parsing configuration files, such as `libyaml`, `jsoncpp`, or Python's `PyYAML` or `json` module.
- **Build Process**: You can use Python's `subprocess` module or the C++ `system()` function to execute shell commands for generating build files and invoking the build system (e.g., `make`, `ninja`).
- **Cross-Platform Detection**: Tools like `autoconf` or scripts that check for the OS and compiler can be reused.

### Example Project Structure

```plaintext
my_build_system/
├── src/
│   └── main.cpp
│   └── utils.cpp
├── my_build_system.yaml
├── build/
│   └── Makefile
└── tests/
    └── test_main.cpp
```

### Languages and Technologies to Use

- **C++**: For performance and close-to-hardware control, consider implementing your build system in C++. You can start small and gradually add more features.
- **Python**: If you want quick prototyping and ease of script execution, Python is a great choice for creating custom build systems, thanks to its extensive libraries.

By combining these elements, you can develop an infrastructure similar to CMake but customized for your needs. Let me know if you want more detailed guidance on a specific step!
